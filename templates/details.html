            <dt>Rod Shaping and Reduction</dt>
            <dd class="para2">Once the silver is in a molten state,
             it is cast into rod-shaped forms. These rods are then further processed to achieve the desired thickness
              and size for the anklets. This shaping and reduction process involves heating 
              the rods and manipulating them to the desired dimensions.
             This step is crucial for creating the basic structure of the anklets.
             These steps are part of the initial manufacturing process for silver anklets. 
             After shaping and reducing the silver rods, additional steps such as cutting, bending, and adding decorative elements may be performed
              to create the final anklet design.<br>

             Here's a more detailed breakdown of this step:<br>
            <b> Cutting the Rods: </b>The silver rods, which have been shaped and reduced in size, are cut into shorter sections. These sections will form individual links of the anklet chain.
            <br>
             <b>Shaping Links:</b> Each section of the rod is further shaped into a specific link design. This shaping process may involve bending, twisting, or forming the silver to create the desired chain pattern.
            <br>  
             <b>Assembling the Chain:</b>Skilled artisans or workers carefully assemble the individual links to create the anklet chain. This is often done by connecting the links together using various techniques, such as soldering, weaving, or using jump rings.
            <br> 
             <b>Quality Control: </b>Throughout the chain assembly process, quality control checks are performed to ensure that each link is securely connected, and the chain maintains the desired design and length.
            <br>  
             <b>Adjusting Length:</b> Depending on the design and desired length of the anklet, adjustments may be made to the chain during this step. Extra links can be added or removed to achieve the correct fit for the ankle.
